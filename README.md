# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

The stack12.cpp reads specified commands from a text file such as the fruit.txt file and 
then will create a stack or queue of the specified type if it does not exist already 
It will then push or pop values onto the data structure as appropriate.
An output file needs to be specified to denote completion of commands.
